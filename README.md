Followed a bunch of videos on generating terrain. Now trying to get this player thing working and not falling off map. Also working on spawning trees.

### Sunday, December 28th | 2 hours

Wrote a lot of logic to spawn trees. Then made it so it can be at a higher density than the mesh, but having a bit of issues with making follow the mesh height. Think I'll fix it tmrw, but I also smell issues with lag and needing scaling everything up, should probly do it porberly instead of using scaling.

Got the trees to spawn in the right spots, but the height is off for some reason, will look into ts tmrw morning.

### Tuesday, December 30th | x hours

#### 16:30 | 0 hours

Goal today is to write my own chunking system AND NOT USE ANY CLANKERS. To do this I am going to start by making the game take multiple meshes and renderthem together as multiple chunks. Then make it only active (i think thats the term) the chunks < x blocks from player.

#### 17:00 | 3 hours

Started working on the chunking logic. Got to testing placing single chunks and its not working but im getting errors so not gonna be too hard to fix I hope. Will fix after dinner.
