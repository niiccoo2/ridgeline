Followed a bunch of videos on generating terrain. Now trying to get this player thing working and not falling off map. Also working on spawning trees.

Wrote a lot of logic to spawn trees. Then made it so it can be at a higher density than the mesh, but having a bit of issues with making follow the mesh height. Think I'll fix it tmrw, but I also smell issues with lag and needing scaling everything up, should probly do it porberly instead of using scaling.

Got the trees to spawn in the right spots, but the height is off for some reason, will look into ts tmrw morning.
